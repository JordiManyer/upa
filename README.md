# UPA
Aquest Ã©s l'inici d'una aventura ...


## Code structure

UPA is built using CMake, which makes it easier to keep track and compile huge programs.
All the source code is placed in `/src`, and every folder contains a different library
which can be compiled separately. This allows for fast re-compilation when only minor
changes are implemented.

### CMake project structure

Each library has its own `CMakeLists.txt` file, which gives compilation instructions for
the specific library.

The global `CMakeLists.txt` file, located in the main folder, includes all libraries
and takes care of the global compilation.

The `src/Tests` folder contains all the executable files, which are compiled separately
and can contain all the different applications we want to have.

### Install folders

When compiling and installing the code, `/include` and `/libs` contain the `.h` files
and `.a` libraries respectively. The `/bin` folder contains the compiled executables
(one for each file in `/src/Tests`). The `/build` folder contains all the compilation
files generated by CMake.

## Compilation

To compile UPA, move into `/build` on a terminal and do the following:

First, generate the compilation files using CMake :

`` cmake ..``

Finally, compile the code :

`` make install ``
